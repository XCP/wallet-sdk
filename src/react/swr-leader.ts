/**
 * One tab polls, the rest listen.
 *
 * Every open tab of this site is an independent set of SWR pollers, and the
 * Counterparty node rate-limits by IP — so a person with ten tabs open is ten
 * visitors to the limiter and one to us. This middleware makes N tabs cost
 * what one tab costs, without touching a single call site: any `useSWR` with
 * a `refreshInterval` takes part automatically.
 *
 * How, in three parts:
 *
 *  1. ELECTION. Each polled key gets a Web Lock named after it. The tab that
 *     holds the lock is that key's leader and keeps its refreshInterval; every
 *     other tab with the same key mounted has its interval set to zero. Locks
 *     are per key, not per tab, so two tabs on different pages each lead their
 *     own keys and a tab on the same page follows. When the leader closes or
 *     navigates away, the browser hands the lock to the next tab in line —
 *     failover with no heartbeat, no timestamps, nothing to expire.
 *
 *  2. VISIBILITY. Only a visible tab asks for a lock, and a leader that is
 *     hidden gives its lock up. SWR already pauses intervals in hidden tabs,
 *     so a hidden leader would mean nobody polling while a visible follower
 *     waits; this keeps the polling tab the one being looked at. When every
 *     tab is hidden nobody polls, exactly as before.
 *
 *  3. DELIVERY. The leader posts each successful fetch on a BroadcastChannel,
 *     and followers write it straight into their SWR cache for that key. A
 *     follower still fetches once on mount — it has nothing to show until
 *     then — but after that it never asks the network for a polled key again
 *     while someone else leads.
 *
 * Without Web Locks or BroadcastChannel (Safari before 15.4), every tab is its
 * own leader, which is precisely the behaviour this replaces.
 *
 * Lives in @xcp/wallet-sdk/react. It needs only `use: [leaderPolling]` on the SWRConfig.
