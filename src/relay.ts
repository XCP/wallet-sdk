/**
 * One Counterparty read, tried directly and then through our own origin.
 *
 * api.counterparty.io sits behind Google Cloud Armor, and counterparty-core
 * knows it does — `lib/api/healthz.py` carries a `/rate-limited` route
 * documented as "used as a target for Cloud Armor rate limiting rules", which
 * answers 429 WITH the CORS headers a browser needs to read it. When
 * enforcement takes that path, a rate-limited visitor gets a real status.
 *
 * When it does not — a rule that denies at the edge instead of redirecting —
 * the response is Cloud Armor's own, carries no CORS headers, and the browser
 * refuses to expose it. What reaches script is a bare TypeError: no status, no
 * body, and nothing in the network tab. Error handling keyed on a status code
 * never fires, because there is no status.
 *
 * There is no second public node to ask — dev.counterparty.io:4000 is gone and
 * nothing else answers — so the fallback is a host we run, and it is the SAME
 * ORIGIN as the page rather than a subdomain. A relay is only worth having
 * when the alternative is unreachable, and an origin the visitor already has
 * open is the one address no filter list, DNS block, or CORS policy can take
 * away.
 *
 * Second, never first. Direct stays primary so the traffic stays free and in
 * the browser, and so the only requests arriving at the relay are the ones
 * with nowhere else to go. That is not only about cost: every relayed visitor
 * shares one egress IP upstream, so making it the default would turn a
 * per-visitor rate limit into a per-site one and convert an individual outage
 * into a total one.
 *
 * Lives in @xcp/wallet-sdk, shared by every XCP site. It needs one thing from its host: a route serving RELAY_BASE
 * that forwards GET /v2/* to the node (see app/api/cp/[...path]/route.ts). A
 * repo without that route still works — the relay 404s and the direct answer
 * stands — it just gets no protection.

 * the same window, and a page with a handful of pollers can hold itself out
 * indefinitely without a single one of them succeeding.
 *
 * We cannot see the limit. Cloud Armor's rules are not ours to read, there is

 * wait a cycle and nobody notices, while a person who pressed a button is
 * doing the one thing the site exists for. Under a throttle the pollers stand
 * down and the buttons keep working, which is the right way round — and it is

 * the buttons.
