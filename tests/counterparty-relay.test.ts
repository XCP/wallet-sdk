/**
 * When a Counterparty read is retried through our own origin, when it is not,
 * and how much of that any one browser is allowed.
 *
 * Two things here are easy to get backwards and expensive to get wrong.
 *
 * The first is that a rate limiter counts what it REJECTS, so the obvious
 * always-try-direct-first shape is what keeps the door shut: every read during
 * a throttle spends another rejected request against the same window.
 *
 * The second is that the relay has one egress IP for every visitor, so a
 * throttled page that simply redirects its full poll rate at us trades a limit
 * it hit alone for one it hits on everybody's behalf. A relay that is itself
 * rate limited is worth nothing to anyone, so background reads are budgeted
 * and user-driven ones are not.
